to provide a new level of assurance for both internal and external parties through risk based authentication entrust offers a range of authentication capabilities with its authentication platform so that specific methods can be used with specific users and applications first steps can be as simple as deploying ssl certificates or user name and password entrust has long played a key role in this space through our ssl and single sign on products risk based authentication however goes much deeper than ssl and single sign on risk based authentication has the ability to judge each individual transaction on its own merits driven by policy level decisions on the level of risk associated with certain transactions with entrust s risk based authentication solution transactions can be monitored in real time and then a determination can be made on the level of security required for that transaction this is done through the combination of entrust identityguard and entrust transactionguard this combined offering is a modern architecture for consumer authentication which has a layered approach of non invasive anomaly detection and selective intervention with minimal impact on the user experience product category financial metrics entrust emerging growth products accounted for #% $# million of product revenue for q # # for the full year # emerging growth product revenue accounted for #% of total product revenue entrust pki products accounted for #% $# million of product revenue for q # # for the full year # pki product revenue accounted for #% of total product revenue and increased #% over # entrust single sign on products accounted for #% $# million of product revenue for q # # for the full year # single sign on product revenue accounted for #% of total product revenue these three categories are how we report our product revenue externally but do not directly correlate to our three platforms that we use with customers we also provide support and maintenance services to our customers support and maintenance revenue made of nearly two thirds of our total services revenues in q # of # achieving record high levels it is important to note that we achieved record renewals in the fourth quarter of # both in terms of customer retention rate and the dollar value of retention the customer retention rate and the associated dollar value renewals were over # percent in # we also provide professional services including architecture installation and integration services related to the products that we sell our support and maintenance and our professional services have shown consistent steady growth and since q # # have achieved # quarters of sequential quarter over quarter revenue growth in # deferred revenue increased $# million to $# million from year end # the increase in deferred revenue was driven by an increase in subscription product bookings #% of the increase and support and maintenance renewals these numbers show the continued strength of our support and maintenance renewals and the growth in our subscription based software growth # # table of contents in the fourth quarter of # entrust achieved a net income of $# per share which is an improvement of $# per share from a net loss of $# per share in the fourth quarter of # during # we have significantly reduced our total expenses through a combination of managed headcount reductions lowering of contracting expenses and controlling variable operating costs those expense reduction initiatives were somewhat offset by the additional costs we are experiencing due to the appreciation of the canadian dollar from approximately $# per us dollar at the beginning of the year to $# per u s dollar exchange rate at the end of # this increase in the canadian dollar to the u s dollar cost entrust nearly $# million in additional expense in # entrust sells its solutions globally with an emphasis on north america europe and asia these primary areas have demonstrated the most potential for early adoption of the broadest set of entrust solutions entrust extends to other non core geographies through strategic partner relationships which increases the leverage of our direct sales channel worldwide in north america entrust is targeting a return to revenue growth in its software business by leveraging entrust s historical strength in selling to key verticals such as government federal state provincial financial services and global # enterprises europe and the middle east are regions where entrust s products and solutions continue to experience strong demand and we believe that this market will provide growth with increased momentum from governments and enterprises leveraging entrust s solutions to transform their business processes and to leverage the internet and networking applications we market and sell our products and services in both the enterprise and government market space in q # # #% of our product sales were in our extended government vertical market which includes healthcare for the year #% of product revenue was driven by extended government customers around the world this revenue has been driven by key global projects that have started to increase product purchases in the extended government vertical market we have a strong penetration in the u s federal government the governments of canada singapore denmark the united kingdom kingdom of saudi arabia and across continental europe in fact entrust now counts # of the top # e governments as set forth in a report of accenture issued in june # as customers a key change in the government space has been the movement from purely internal security solutions that our customers require to more external citizen facing applications these projects include epassports national id programs eborders physical and logical access programs for government employees and a growing number of citizen facing applications security is at the core of all these projects and our wide product set positions entrust well in this space we have already announced six epassport projects that entrust has won and we have been selected as the infrastructure for a number of national id and ministry of defense programs in # we won national pki infrastructures in the kingdom of saudi arabia brunei and slovenia specifically we had one million dollar transaction in the # rd quarter for the saudi arabia pki infrastructure and in the fourth quarter their eportal infrastructure was our largest transaction in q # # #% of our product sales were in our extended enterprise vertical market we continue to see demand from global enterprises as they continue to respond to regulatory and governance compliance demands and extend their internal and external networks to more and more individuals inside and outside their domain we have experienced a change in the shape of many enterprise deals specifically enterprises are buying for their immediate need and then adding to their purchases as the projects begin roll out our largest vertical within the enterprise market is the financial services vertical in the fourth quarter of # financial services accounted for #% of product revenue although financial services remain our second largest vertical our revenue from this vertical was impacted by financial institutions exposure to sub prime issues in the second half of # we did have very good success in the financial vertical in chile where we won nine banks with our risk based authentication solution in the fourth quarter a key driver of our product growth has been the recent spotlight on identity theft due to breaches at companies like choicepoint lexisnexis and tjx these breaches have proven that self regulation over the past # # table of contents few years has been insufficient at addressing the underlying issues recent legislation has addressed these concerns california s b # has cast more visibility on the issue for citizens corporations and the government the law requires both corporations and the government to notify california residents if their sensitive data has been breached unless encryption technology is deployed additionally more than # states have now passed breach notification requirements entrust for years has been a leader in securing digital identities and information in the fourth quarter of # we introduced identityguard which is our easy to use second factor of authentication solution in q # # identityguard product revenue was $# million its highest level of the year entrust identityguard transactions increased to # in # up #% from # in # new customer acquisition was strong in # with # of the # transactions coming from new customers as of december # # we have over # million licensed users of identityguard and have gone over $# million in total sales of the solution identityguard s low cost point its simplicity for the mass market and its effectiveness in countering online theft and phishing are the key drivers for the increased revenue growth we are experiencing along with the revenue growth for second factor authentication we are also seeing customers increasingly interested in data protection and encryption with a combination of entrust identityguard getaccess and truepass customers can accomplish authentication and role based access control digital signature and encryption from one solution provider in the first quarter of # entrust introduced the industry s first $# one time passcode otp security token in the second quarter we made the product commercially available and delivered our tokens to our first customers in addition to the otp token entrust identityguard customers enjoy a range of authentication methods from a single platform this provides unprecedented flexibility and choice customers currently do not have with existing otp token vendors in april # entrust introduced a managed public key infrastructure pki service this service was launched in response to customer requests for entrust to offer a hosted service to give them a choice between a service offering for pki certificates and our traditional pki software purchase option our service offering is designed to help enterprises and government agencies grow and accelerate their core business security without having to develop pki expertise internally in december # the entrust managed pki service made the general services administration gsa list of approved shared service providers this status enables entrust to help federal agencies reap the security benefits of pki without having to maintain the certification authority ca themselves in q # # we became the primary supplier for the us federal government s general services administration hspd # directive our managed service is not our first entrance into the services business we have been helping our customers for years design deploy and manage our solutions we have also been successful in growing our ssl certificate business which increased over #% in the fourth quarter over last year and increased #% for the full year with the introduction of the new extended validation ssl certificates and unified communications certificates we should be able to grow this business into # entrust in the past has relied significantly on large deals meaning deals of $# million or more in each quarter we have over the past few years reduced this dependence but they remain a significant portion of our product revenue on a quarterly basis our software revenue from our top five customers in q # # was approximately #% of our total revenue in that quarter and we did not have a product deal over $# million in the quarter these numbers were slightly outside our historical range which is generally between #% and #% of revenue from the top five customers and zero to four transactions over $# million in # nearly # percent of our product revenue came from transactions under $# thousand this shift in our business model to more smaller transactions has reduced our dependence on deals over $# thousand we continue to be impacted from time to time on our software revenue by the timing of our customers buying process which may include proof of concepts senior management reviews and budget delays that # # table of contents sometimes results in longer than anticipated sales cycles we are also impacted by our customers recent buying behavior which is to buy only for immediate need as opposed to making a larger purchase in order to get a better discount any of these factors may impact our revenue on a quarterly basis our management uses the following metrics to measure performance number and average size of product revenue transactions number of deals over $# million and # months within # months # months # months # months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents $ # $ $ $ $ # $ $ $ investments classified as short term marketable investments # total amortized cost $ # $ $ $ $ # $ $ $ fair value $ # $ $ $ $ # $ $ $ we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers as a result we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes the fair values of these instruments were determined by net present values in this sensitivity analysis we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities all other factors were held constant if there were an adverse change in interest rates of #% the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be less than $# thousand risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates specifically between the united states and canada the united kingdom the european union and japan this exposure is not considered to be material with respect to the united kingdom european and japanese operations due to the fact that these operations are not significant however because a disproportionate amount of our expenses are denominated in canadian dollars through our canadian operations while our canadian denominated revenue streams are cyclical we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar and in particular fluctuations between the u s and canadian dollar therefore a favorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in higher revenues when translated into u s dollars but would also mean expenses would be higher in a corresponding fashion and to a greater degree historically we have not engaged in formal hedging activities but we do periodically review the potential impact of this foreign exchange risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses is minimized however as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars our reported expense base increased by $# million in # when compared to # due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states # # table of contents and canadian dollars taking into account the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on reported canadian revenues the net effect on reported earnings was $# million for # when compared to # in the past when perceived by management to be advantageous we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars to cover exposures on canadian subsidiary s expenses that are denominated in canadian dollars in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility that might result from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian and u s dollar during the fourth quarter of # we engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars covering exposures on approximately $# million of our canadian subsidiary s expenses denominated in canadian dollars none of these contracts extended past december # # and no previously purchased foreign exchange contracts had extended past september # # subsequent to year end we have engaged in forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars covering exposures on approximately $# million of expenses denominated in canadian dollars in the first quarter of # we currently have not engaged in any forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars to cover exposures on expenses denominated in canadian dollars in future periods beyond the first quarter of # risk associated with long term strategic investments we hold an investment in ohana with a net carrying value at december # # of $# thousand representing approximately #% of the issued common shares of ohana during # we were informed of an ohana re financing which coupled with the changes in the business outlook led us to conclude that the expectations for ohana had not materialized and an impairment charge was required to adjust the net carrying value of our equity ownership as a result we recorded in # an impairment of our investment in ohana of $# thousand this investment is now accounted for under the cost method ohana is in the start up or development stage and may lack the financial resources licenses technology and governmental approvals necessary to import develop or offer for sale any commercial product or service if the demand for ohana s products and services materializes slowly to a minimum extent or not at all in the relevant market we could lose all or substantially all of our remaining investment entrust does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes
